# BFSIM

This is a small, simple and experimental simulator for the lovely language called `Brianfuck`, written in python. While `bfsim.py` handles the parsing as well as the simulation, `inp_handler.py` watches STDIN for user input.

## Example

I've attached an example called `ttt.bf`, short for Tic Tac Toe. The code stems from [mitxela](https://mitxela.com/projects/bf_tic_tac_toe), I'm just simulating it here. To play, run it like this:

```bash
python bfsim.py ttt.bf
```

Python's version needs to be `>=3.0`.
